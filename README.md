## Rijksoverheid Visualisatie - utils

## Description
ROvis.utils is an R package that provides a comprehensive suite of utilities for visualizing in Rijksoverheid style.

## Installation

```r
# Install from GitHub (private repo - requires GitHub auth, e.g. a PAT
# via usethis::create_github_token() / gitcreds, since this repo is private)
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rivm-syso/ROvis.utils")
```

For more information, check out the [wiki page about daratools](https://gitlab.rivm.nl/dara/wiki/-/wikis/DARAtools).


## Usage
*Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate inline, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.*

## Support
First point of contact for questions: ROvis team (spin@rivm.nl)

## Roadmap
*If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.*

## Contributing
*State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.*

## Instructions for developers 

Check out the [wiki page about r packages](https://gitlab.rivm.nl/dara/wiki/-/wikis/DARAtools) 
for elaborate information about R package development. Below we describe the most important 
guidelines and practicalities.


### Requirements
We use the `testthat`, `lintr` and `roxygen2` package for development of tests, code style 
checks and automatic documentation. We also use the `devtools` and `usethis` package during 
development to adhere to standards for R packages and make developing easier! Install them 
in your Rstudio environment:

```r
install.packages(testthat)
install.packages(lintr)
install.packages(roxygen2)
install.packages(quarto)
install.packages(pkgdown)
install.packages(devtools)
install.packages(usethis)
```

### Guidelines
Type `devtools::load_all()` in your console each time you start developing. This loads 
all dependencies and non-exported functions in the NAMESPACE. This makes developing a lot easier!

To ensure code standardization and quality, follow these guidelines:
- Add tests with `usethis::use_test()`
- Add a new package dependency to the DESCRIPTION file with `usethis::use_package()`. We use 
the `min_version` argument to specify a minimum version. 
- Add a new function dependency to the NAMESPACE with `usethis::use_import_from()`
- Add documentation to new functions by inserting a roxygen skeleton and use `devtools::document()` to
create automatic documentation in the `man` folder, for more information check out this 
[wiki section](https://gitlab.rivm.nl/dara/wiki/-/wikis/Create%20your%20own%20R%20packages#documentation)
